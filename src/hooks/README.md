# use18Effect
A custom hook that implements useEffect hook in React 18+ as it was meant to be executed

- The hook uses the same implementation of the normal useEffect hook that we all love
- But with the removal of twice rendering on first mount on react 18 + strict mode
- Note: use it with the development version only.
